        <p>For my first project, I made a <a href="https://jvgorf.github.io/fishtank/" target="_blank">browser based fish tank game</a>. Okay, well, it's not really much of a game, but I like it. You start off with one fish and very few minutes or so, food will float up from the sandy bottom for your fish to eat. For every 50 food that your fish consumes, another fish will join the tank. 
        <br><br>
        Note the options icon. From here you can customize the colors of your fish as you unlock the ability (also by eating food). Additional fish that join your tank will contain random colors. Since each fish has 3 colors and there is a pool of 18 colors to choose from, that means there are 5832 unique color combinations.
        <br><br>
        I completed this project over the course of 13 days putting in anywhere between 15 minutes to 1 hour per day and skipping a day or 2.
