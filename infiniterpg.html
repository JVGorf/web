        <h2>An infinite RPG world</h2>
        <p>I was tossing around this idea for an <a href="https://jvgorf.github.io/InfiniteWorld/" target="_blank" id="hover-link">infinite text based RPG world</a> with a walkable world that runs in your browser. As a proof of concept I came up with a simple random terrain generator that at first wasn't very convincing but it's starting to take shape. It's simple really, it's a top-down world with tiles but instead of using images for the tiles, I'm using a monospace font.</p>
        <div id="hover-preview"></div>
        
        <p>So it's a little like the OG version of Dwarf Fortress that used ASCII characters but in my case, it's played in a browser and instead of being a colony sim, it's [potentially] an RPG or survival game. <b>The primary feature is that the world is *infinetly large and generated as you explore, which is something you don't often see with a browser game.</b> How far I'll take it remains to be seen but for now it's a concept project.
        <br><br>
        *Technically it's not "infinite" because your browser will never contain enough allocated RAM to let you run forever, but effectively it's about as infinite as you can get, especially for a browser RPG.
